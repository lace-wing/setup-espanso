# setup-espanso
Lacewing's [Espanso](https://espanso.org) setup.

## Usage
[Espanso](https://espanso.org) allows you to use system-wide snippets.
Of course they are customizable and configurable.
Read [the documentation](https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/) to get started.

This repo contains Lacewing's personal setup Espanso setup.
You can expect **general snippets** such as date and time.
Moreover, there are snippets for **chatting**, for **gaming**, specifically for **Terraria** and **tModLoader**, or simply for **fun**.
Some of the snippets are only written for **Simplified Chinese** at this point (translations are welcomed).

To use those snippet, you can scan through the `trigger`s, `triggers`s and `regex`s or use Espanso's search bar to get an idea of the snippets.
If you want only a part of these snippets, or a deviated version of them, feel free to modify them.
Also, the [documentation](https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/) is alwasy there!
